# Nuclear Weapons Warehouse
Reworked version from 500% gamemode in overwatch workshop. Objective from this version is to customize more and easy to balance heroes and also add new features. I've inspired an original version (i really don't know who is original author since this 500% version was reuploaded many times before).

So i decide to rework and bring more code readability also, because original code was random words, and unamed variables that makes difficulty to understand what something exactly does.

# Share Code
You can import builtin code: `ATXAX` or compile yourself with OverPy and VsCode.

# Tools
- OverPy: Highlevel language for working in workshop scripts. <https://github.com/Zezombye/overpy/>
- VSCode: Powerful code editor. <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

# Notes
- I DONT recommend using workshop editor in some actions, because your game can crash.
- If you have any idea, suggestion or bug report, please open an issue and i can help.
- Have an file called `debug.opy` that will compile same code but without proper workshop optimizations, don't use unless you really know what you are doing!

# Todo List
- Auto balance teams with bots or moving player slots, maybe an setting to this would be better.
- Fix more bugs that may exist.


### Thanks for playing the gamemode and have many fun or test your patienceðŸ¤£.
